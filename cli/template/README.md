# p5.js + TypeScript + Vite Template
A simple p5 template to quickly get a project going, using Vite as a bundler + dev server.
It also includes a `globals.d.ts` file that gives you intellisense when using p5 in global mode.

## Usage
I'm using yarn but you can use whatever package manager or runtime you want
```
git clone https://github.com/williamcostello/p5-ts-starter.git
cd p5-ts-start
yarn install
yarn dev
```
