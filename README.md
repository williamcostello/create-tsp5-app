# p5.js + TypeScript + Vite Template
A simple p5 template to quickly get a project going, using Vite as a bundler + dev server.

## Motivation
The `p5.js` web editor is a fantastic tool, but I often find myself missing the features my IDE offers. This package aims to make it as quick and easy as using the web editor to get a project running locally with TypeScript, a development server, and the joys of using your own editor setup. The `globals.d.ts` file also enables intellisense when using p5 in global mode.

## Usage
```
// Initialise the project
npx create-tsp5-app

// Install dependencies
npm install
// OR
yarn install

// Run the dev server
npm run dev
// OR
yarn dev
```
